Bio:

Graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Geography and a Masters in M & E, I have been in the GIS sector for close to 10 years now and have worked for various international organizations in an Information Management capacity.

My motivation for joining HOT is to prmomote crowd sourced maps and engage with communities directly through mapping.
